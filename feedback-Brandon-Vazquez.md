# Website Feedback – Digital Canvas

## 💻 Digital Canvas Section

- **Navbar**: Add a blur effect for better contrast and readability; current text is difficult to read.
- **Hero Section**: Consider simplifying the initial view—there’s too much going on visually, which can overwhelm users.
- **Creative Journey Boxes**: Hover and press animations are inconsistent and feel buggy—recommend revising or unifying animation behavior.
- **Buttons**:
  - "Join Community" and most social buttons are non-functional—ensure they’re linked properly or removed.
  - Button overlaps occur in Creative Journey popups and again in the social section at the end—adjust layout and z-index as needed.
- **Pricing Section**:
  - Confusing to have two pricing options listed at the same price—clarify value differences or remove redundancy.
  - Program details don’t update based on user selection—this creates confusion.
  - Purchase layout looks too much like a receipt—consider a more intuitive, modern layout.
  - Move FAQs further down to reduce noise and improve visual hierarchy.
  - The top selection options (Standard vs Premium) should have **interactive buttons** allowing users to go directly to purchase.
  - Add actual purchase functionality—currently, nothing seems to process payment.
- **Industry Experts**: All use the same image—consider replacing with real images or at least distinct placeholders.
- **Call to Action**: “Ready to Transform Your Workflow?” would be better placed *after* the purchasing section to maintain narrative flow.

## 📩 Ending Section

- Move the **“Stay Updated”** text *into* the newsletter box so it visually matches the “Education Series” section.
- Remove any **unused or broken social icons**.
- Place **Newsletter** and **Education Series** side-by-side, with matching sizes and layout.
- Move the **Connect** section to the bottom to improve page structure and cohesion.

## ❓ Questions

- Is the **Education Series** section permanent, or is it seasonal/rotational? Clarifying this helps with content planning and layout permanence.
