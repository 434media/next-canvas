 *   1. Email
 *   2. How valuable was today's session? (1 = Very Valuable … 5 = Not Valuable)
 *   3. What was most useful — or what would've made it better?
 *   4. Would you like to talk further about AI in your operations?
 *   5. Name
 *   6. Company
 *   7. Your Role
 *   8. Your Industry
 *   9. What's your single biggest question or blocker with AI right now?
 *  10. How did you hear about today's session?
